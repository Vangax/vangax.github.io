          <h3 class="title-red">the idea becomes real</h3>

          <p>
            for a long time, ever since i watched the movie interstellar the idea of tars
            (an ai robot that helped humans) lived only in my head. in february 2025,
            i decided to stop thinking about it and actually try building something.
            there was no plan, no roadmap, and no research goal at this stage. i just
            wanted to see if i could create a small assistant that worked on my own
            machine and felt <span class="kw">personal</span>.
          </p>

          <p>
            i started by installing a <span class="kw">large language model</span> locally using
            <span class="kw">ollama</span>. the decision to keep everything
            <span class="kw">offline</span> was intentional. i wanted to understand
            what an ai system feels like when it has no internet, no cloud support, and
            no shortcuts.
          </p>

          <h3 class="title-purple">giving the system a personality</h3>

          <p>
            once the system was running locally, i started thinking less about answers
            and more about <span class="kw">behavior</span>. i experimented with ways to control how the system
            responds, adding adjustable settings for humor, joke frequency, and overall
            seriousness during conversations.
          </p>

          <p>
            one feature that felt especially important to me was control. i added a
            trigger phrase, <span class="kw">"hey its serious now tars"</span>, which switches the system into
            a <span class="kw">focused mode</span>. in this state, the assistant(tars) ignores casual language and
            concentrates only on solving the problem i give it.

          <p>
            as i used the system more, typing started to feel limiting. i wanted the
            interaction to feel closer to how humans naturally communicate. i integrated
            a <span class="kw">speech recognition system</span> so i could talk to him directly.
          </p>

          <p>
            i also spent time adjusting his voice same as tars from the movie. this made
            the assistant feel more dependable and less like a toy and it was really
            fun sometimes because when it was in non focused mode, tars would make
            funny or unfunny jokes during the work.

          <p>
            by march 2025, this project was no longer just something i played with.
            using the system daily, completely offline, changed how i think about ai
            i started seeing <span class="kw">intelligent agents</span> as tools that could genuinely support
            humans in environments where connectivity is unreliable or unavailable
            i started to think about if there's an major outbreak these ai systems
            can help humans in a way never imagined before.
          </p>

          <p>
            this experience made me want to take this idea further at a research level.
            i became interested in how <span class="kw">autonomous ai systems</span> can be designed to be
            controllable, reliable, and helpful, while still remaining flexible enough
            to adapt to different situations and users.

          <p>
            while working on different machine learning and deep learning projects,
            i noticed that models could perform well on paper but still behave
            unpredictably on real data. sometimes predictions looked confident,
            even when they were wrong.
          </p>

          <p>
            this made me start questioning how much trust we should place in model
            outputs, especially when results are used to guide decisions.

          <p>
            this became more clear while working on noisy and real-world datasets,
            including <span class="kw">anomaly detection</span> and
            <span class="kw">scientific data</span>, where false positives and
            false negatives can change how results are interpreted.
          </p>

          <p>
            i realized that knowing <span class="kw">how certain</span> a model is
            can sometimes be more important than the prediction itself.

            this led me to develop a strong interest in
            <span class="kw">uncertainty-aware machine learning</span>.
            i am interested in how models can express confidence and limitations
            instead of giving overconfident answers.

          <p>
            during my master’s studies, i want to explore how uncertainty estimates

            humans make better, more informed choices.

      <p>
        my interest in space started very early. growing up, i was fascinated by
        movies like zathura the space adventure and games like star trek that showed
        different worlds, races, and journeys through space. at that age(5), i did not
        understand the science behind it, but space felt vast and unreal that things like this 
        actually exist!!! 
      </p>

      <p>
        even before i knew what astrophysics meant, i found myself asking simple
        questions about planets, stars, and what exists beyond earth and i remember
        annoying my grade 1 class teacher by showing them cool space images and art
        from a book i had back then and asking her questions about those images all the time

        during school exhibitions, my curiosity turned into physical projects.
        i built models of the solar system and moon's impact on earth's oceans 
        these were simple, but they helped me visualize how planets move and how
        space is structured.
      </p>

      <p>
        this was the first time i realized that space is not just something to
        watch in movies, but something that can be studied and understood.

      <p>
        in high school, my interest in space became more serious through physics.
        i started learning about gravitational force, motion, rotational motion,
        orbits, and basic mechanics related to space and planetary movement and modern
        physics which is my favourite topic in physics.
      </p>

      <p>
        this phase helped me understand that astrophysics is built on strong
        physical principles, not imagination alone.

        when i entered college and started focusing on data science and machine

        interest in space. this is where astronomy and astrophysics began to
        intersect with programming for me.
      </p>

      <p>
        i started exploring multiple research paper related to machine learning models
        and frameworks related to space and space data which naturally led me to start working
        with and implementing models and frameworks on space data and real time data from satellites
        which is available publically.

      <p>
        over the last few years, i have worked on more than six projects related
        to astrophysics, astronomy, computational physics, and space science
        using machine learning and deep learning and neural frameworks - i have tried to
        understand these concepts on my own 
      </p>

      <p>
        these projects include tasks such as exoplanet detection, anomaly
        detection in astronomical data, time-series analysis, and exploratory
        modeling of space-related datasets. through this work, i realized that
        machine learning can act as a powerful tool to support astrophysical
        research rather than replace physical understanding.
      </p>

      <p>
        this journey is why i am deeply interested in pursuing astrophysics
        through a computational and machine learning perspective during my
        master’s studies and beyond.
