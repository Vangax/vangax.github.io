          <h3 class="title-red">the idea becomes real</h3>

          <p>
            for a long time, ever since i watched the movie interstellar,
            the idea of tars lived only in my head. in february 2025,
            i decided to stop thinking and actually try building something.
            i wanted a small assistant that worked on my own machine and felt
            <span class="kw">personal</span>.
          </p>

          <p>
            i installed a <span class="kw">large language model</span> locally
            using <span class="kw">ollama</span>. keeping everything
            <span class="kw">offline</span> was intentional so i could understand
            how an ai system behaves without shortcuts.

          <h3 class="title-purple">giving the system a personality</h3>

          <p>
            once the system was stable, i focused on <span class="kw">behavior</span>.
            i added adjustable settings for humor, joke frequency, and seriousness
            to control how the system responds during conversations.
          </p>

          <p>
            i added a trigger phrase,
            <span class="kw">"hey its serious now tars"</span>,
            which switches the assistant into a
            <span class="kw">focused mode</span>
            where it only concentrates on solving the task.

          <p>
            typing began to feel limiting, so i integrated a
            <span class="kw">speech recognition</span> pipeline and started
            interacting with tars using my voice.
          </p>

          <p>
            i tuned the voice to stay calm and controlled.
            in non focused mode, tars would sometimes make jokes,
            which made the system feel <span class="kw">human</span>
            and enjoyable to use.

          <p>
            by march 2025, this was no longer just an experiment.
            using the system daily changed how i see
            <span class="kw">autonomous ai systems</span>
            as tools that can help humans when connectivity is unreliable.
          </p>

          <p>
            this made me want to explore these systems at a
            <span class="kw">research level</span>, focusing on control,
            reliability, and real-world usefulness.

  <!-- discovery systems -->
  <section id="dl" class="research-section">
    <p>
      my interest in discovery systems focuses on using
      <span class="kw">anomaly detection</span> and data-driven methods
      to surface rare or unexpected patterns in complex datasets.
    </p>

    <p>
      i am especially interested in how these systems can assist
      <span class="kw">scientific discovery</span> by guiding human attention
      rather than replacing human judgment.

    <p>
      i am deeply interested in applying machine learning and deep learning
      to <span class="kw">astrophysical data</span>, especially where noise
      and scale make traditional analysis difficult.
