          <h3 class="title-red">the idea becomes real</h3>

          <p>
            for a long time, ever since i watched the movie interstellar the idea of tars
            (an ai robot that helped humans) lived only in my head. in february 2025,
            i decided to stop thinking about it and actually try building something.
            there was no plan, no roadmap, and no research goal at this stage. i just
            wanted to see if i could create a small assistant that worked on my own
            machine and felt <span class="kw">personal</span>.
          </p>

          <p>
            i started by installing a <span class="kw">large language model</span> locally using
            <span class="kw">ollama</span>. the decision to keep everything
            <span class="kw">offline</span> was intentional. i wanted to understand
            what an ai system feels like when it has no internet, no cloud support, and
            no shortcuts.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- late feb -->
      <div class="timeline-item">
        <div class="timeline-left">
          <span class="timeline-date">late february 2025</span>
          <span class="timeline-dot"></span>
          <span class="timeline-line"></span>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-card">
          <span class="card-tag tag-system">system design</span>
          <h3 class="title-purple">giving the system a personality</h3>

          <p>
            once the system was running locally, i started thinking less about answers
            and more about <span class="kw">behavior</span>. i experimented with ways to control how the system
            responds, adding adjustable settings for humor, joke frequency, and overall
            seriousness during conversations.
          </p>

          <p>
            one feature that felt especially important to me was control. i added a
            trigger phrase, <span class="kw">"hey its serious now tars"</span>, which switches the system into
            a <span class="kw">focused mode</span>. in this state, the assistant(tars) ignores casual language and
            concentrates only on solving the problem i give it.

      <!-- early march -->
      <div class="timeline-item">
        <div class="timeline-left">
          <span class="timeline-date">early march 2025</span>
          <span class="timeline-dot"></span>
          <span class="timeline-line"></span>

        <div class="timeline-card">
          <span class="card-tag tag-interaction">human–ai interaction</span>
          <h3 class="title-blue">learning how humans talk to machines</h3>

          <p>
            as i used the system more, typing started to feel limiting. i wanted the
            interaction to feel closer to how humans naturally communicate. i integrated
            a <span class="kw">speech recognition system</span> so i could talk to him directly.
          </p>

          <p>
            i also spent time adjusting his voice same as tars from the movie. this made
            the assistant feel more dependable and less like a toy and it was really
            fun sometimes because when it was in non focused mode, tars would make
            funny or unfunny jokes during the work.

          <span class="card-tag tag-research">research direction</span>
          <h3 class="title-green">from experiment to research interest</h3>

          <p>
            by march 2025, this project was no longer just something i played with.
            using the system daily, completely offline, changed how i think about ai
            i started seeing <span class="kw">intelligent agents</span> as tools that could genuinely support
            humans in environments where connectivity is unreliable or unavailable
            i started to think about if there's an major outbreak these ai systems
            can help humans in a way never imagined before.
          </p>

          <p>
            this experience made me want to take this idea further at a research level.
            i became interested in how <span class="kw">autonomous ai systems</span> can be designed to be
            controllable, reliable, and helpful, while still remaining flexible enough
            to adapt to different situations and users.
