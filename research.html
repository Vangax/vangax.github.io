      <h3>the idea becomes real</h3>
      <p>
        for a long time, the idea of tars lived only in my head. in february 2025,
        i decided to stop thinking about it and actually try building something.
        there was no plan, no roadmap, and no research goal at this stage. i just
        wanted to see if i could create a small assistant that worked on my own
        machine and felt personal.
      </p>
      <p>
        i started by installing a large language model locally using ollama. the
        decision to keep everything offline was intentional. i wanted to understand
        what an ai system feels like when it has no internet, no cloud support, and
        no shortcuts.
      </p>

      <h3>giving the system a personality</h3>
      <p>
        once the system was running locally, i started thinking less about answers
        and more about behavior. i experimented with ways to control how the system
        responds, adding adjustable settings for humor, joke frequency, and overall
        seriousness during conversations.
      </p>
      <p>
        one feature that felt especially important to me was control. i added a
        trigger phrase, "hey its serious now tars", which switches the system into
        a focused mode. in this state, the assistant ignores casual language and
        concentrates only on solving the problem i give it.

      <h3>learning how humans talk to machines</h3>
      <p>
        as i used the system more, typing started to feel limiting. i wanted the
        interaction to feel closer to how humans naturally communicate. i integrated
        a speech recognition pipeline so i could talk to the assistant directly.
      </p>
      <p>
        i also spent time adjusting the voice output. instead of making it expressive
        or dramatic, i aimed for something calm and controlled, inspired by tars.
        this made the assistant feel more dependable and less like a toy.

      <h3>from experiment to research interest</h3>
      <p>
        by march 2025, this project was no longer just something i played with.
        using the system daily, completely offline, changed how i think about ai.
        i started seeing intelligent agents as tools that could genuinely support
        humans in environments where connectivity is unreliable or unavailable.
      </p>
      <p>
        this experience made me want to take this idea further at a research level.
        i became interested in how autonomous ai systems can be designed to be
        controllable, reliable, and helpful, while still remaining flexible enough
        to adapt to different situations and users.

    <p>
      my deep learning interests include convolutional and recurrent
      neural networks for image and sequential data, as well as
      modern representation learning techniques.
    </p>

    <p>
      i am interested in training dynamics, overfitting control,
      and understanding the trade-offs between model complexity
      and generalization, especially in data-limited scenarios.

  <!-- astrophysics -->
  <section id="astro" class="research-section">

    <p>
      i am strongly interested in applying machine learning and deep
      learning techniques to astrophysical and planetary science data.
      this interest is motivated by the scale, noise, and complexity
      of observational datasets.

      specific areas of interest include time-series analysis of

      and anomaly detection in noisy light curve data.
